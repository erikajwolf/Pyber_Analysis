# Pyber Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
### Purpose
V. Isualize has given us a new assignment--to create an analysis by ride-sharing type. They want to see the weekly fares for each city type. This gives another insight into the data that PyBer collects. Each view of data, daily, weekly, by city type, average fare, etc. provides us with another view and understanding of what is happening at Pyber. Different views allow for the most informed decisions, and wanting to see a weekly breakdown will provide V. Isualize with different knowledge.
