# Pyber Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
### Purpose
V. Isualize has given us a new assignment--to create an analysis by ride-sharing type. They want to see the weekly fares for each city type. This gives another insight into the data that PyBer collects. Each view of data, daily, weekly, by city type, average fare, etc. provides us with another view and understanding of what is happening at Pyber. Different views allow for the most informed decisions, and wanting to see a weekly breakdown will provide V. Isualize with different knowledge.

## Results
### Weekly Fares by City Type
![PyBer_fare_summary](/Pyber_Analysis/Analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)

Above we can see a weekly breakdown of total ride fares per city type. Because Urban cities have the highest count of rides, total Urban fares are highest on the list. Rural cities account for the smallest total of rides, putting Rural cities at the bottom of the list. 

When we take a look at Average Fares by city type, we can see a different picture of Pyber.

Rural city types have the lowest total rides and lowest total drivers, but their average ride fare and average fare per driver are the highest. Because rural neighborhoods are not as densly populated, with riders or with drivers, there seems to be a different ride fare offered to rural vs urban drivers. Are there surcharges being applied in rural areas because of the lack of drivers? This issue does not exist in urban areas--there are high levels of supply and demand, and urban totals are still the highest. 

If PyBer wanted to better serve rural areas, they would have to be more customer facing. In this case, the customer is the rider. For more riders to want to work with PyBer, rates will have to be lowered and more affordable. Driver counts may not necessarily increase, but ridership will increase and the customer base will be more satisfied to use our service.

## Summary
### Business Recommendations
#1 Continue to provide rides at lower rates for Urban and Suburban city types. Because of the density in population, which results in high supply and demand, Urban and Suburban city types have high total fares and total rides.

#2 Lower rates in Rural city types. V. Isualize wanted the graph above to understand how to better serve less dense neighborhoods. It seems as though fares are increased in Rural areas due to a lack of driver counts, but this is just a vicious cycle that deters rural users from wanting to participate in Pyber, causing lower total rider counts.

#3 Continue this analysis to see where trends in rides occur. February has a spike of rides in all three city types, making us wonder if people are taking PyBer out for Valentine's Day. Understanding seasonal trends would help Pyber best prepare for spikes and lulls in traffic, and make more informed decisions regarding fares, driver supply, and rider demand.
